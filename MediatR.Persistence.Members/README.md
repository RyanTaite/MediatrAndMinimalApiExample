The Persistence Layer, often encapsulated within the Infrastructure Layer, is specifically concerned with data storage and retrieval. It includes the implementation of repositories, which are interfaces defined in the Domain Layer. The Persistence Layer's primary responsibility is to translate data between the Domain Layer and the database or other storage mechanisms. The repositories in this layer handle the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion (CRUD) operations for domain entities. The Persistence Layer should be designed to be decoupled from the Domain Layer, with the Domain Layer depending on abstractions (interfaces) defined by the Persistence Layer, not the concrete implementations.
